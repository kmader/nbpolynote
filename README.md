# nbpolynote [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kmader/nbpolynote/master)
A repo setup to make it easy to start polynote in mybinder and create polynote docker images using repo2docker. It should make it easier to have quick demos and make an easier setup. The current version is quite hacky, but we are planning to make it a bit cleaner (PR's welcome!)
